% This is a short example .tex file that I (Gabriel Gress) use to create my documents. The goal of the template is to be clutter-free, so that only things that need to be locally included are present. If I have content or packages that extend over multiple files, I create a .tex file with the packages I need, then import that into each file. If I have content I want to globally appear in all documents made with the template, I put it in the notestemplate.sty file.
% All the commented material within should only be uncommented in the top-most document.
