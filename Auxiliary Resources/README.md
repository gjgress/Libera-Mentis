This folder contains some auxiliary resources that are used to create this project. In /resources/ you will find all the media used during LaTeX compilation (logos etc.). In /snippets/ you will find snippets I used via vim in order to live LaTeX the notes. Finally, in /texmf/ you can find the style files that are necessary to compile the source notes.

This directory is still a WIP.
