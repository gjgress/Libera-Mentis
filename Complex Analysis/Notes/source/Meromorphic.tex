Recall that if a function \(f\) is meromorphic with a pole at \(z_0\) of order \(k\), then \(f\) has a Laurent expansion at \(z_0\) of the form
\begin{align*}
	f(z) = \sum_{n=-k}^{\infty} a_n (z-z_0)^{n}
\end{align*}
and we refer to the partial sum
\begin{align*}
	\sum_{n=-k}^{-1} a_n (z-z_0)^{n}
\end{align*}
as the principal part of \(f\) at \(z_0\).

\begin{thm}[Mittag-Leffler Theorem]
	Let \(\left\{ z_n \right\} \subset \C\) be a sequence of distinct complex numbers with \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| z_n \right|= \infty \). Let \(\left\{ p_n(z) \right\} \) be a sequence of polynomials with \(p_n(0)=0\). Then there exists a function \(f\) meromorphic on the complex plane with poles exclusively at \(\left\{ z_n \right\} \) whose principal part at each \(z_n\) is \(p_n(\frac{1}{z-z_n})\). In fact, every meromorphic function \(f\) with poles at \(\left\{ z_n \right\} \) is of the form
	\begin{align*}
		f(z) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left[ p_n\left( \frac{1}{z-z_n} \right) - q_n(z) \right] + \varphi (z)
	\end{align*}
	for some polynomials \(\left\{ q_n \right\} \) and an entire function \(\varphi \). The sum converges absolutely and uniformly on all \(K\subset \C\) compact with \(K \cap \left\{ z_n \right\} = \emptyset\).
