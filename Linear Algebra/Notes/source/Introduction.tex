\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}


These notes cover the core introductory topics in linear algebra. In particular, it defines and states the major theorems for finite-dimensional vector spaces, as well as defining important terms for all mathematics such as eigenvalues, inner products, operator theory, and more.\\

The lecture notes are based off two main sources. The overall outline and the major statements of theorems and definitions are based off lecture notes from Dr.\@ VÃ¡rilly-Alvarado during the Fall 2019 teaching of Rice's course MATH 354 -- \textit{Honors Linear Algebra}. These notes are supplemented by notes and exercises from Axler's \textit{Linear Algebra Done Right}.
