\chapter{Introduction}

These lecture notes are based on a week-long seminar class taught by Dr. Francesco Maggi at UT Austin at the summer RTG Analysis and PDEs seminar. These cover introductory topics related to calculus of variations, such as first and second variation formulae, gradient flows, and related arguments.
