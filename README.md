# LibreMath

LibreMath is a personal education project created and developed by Gabriel Gress. Its aim is to be a continuously growing free open-source educational resource for students wanting to learn mathematics and other subjects.

At the moment, there's not a lot here. I am a mathematics student, and as I learn mathematics through courses other educational resources, I create my notes via LaTeX. The ones that are polished enough to be worth sharing are put here-- but as I create and polish more notes, I hope this repository can grow as a resource and involve more of the community.

## What is the goal?

My goal is for this repository to become a collaborative hub of free materials. My vision is that the mathematics community can contribute to the resources here, so that the content here can be perfected for others to learn from. As the project develops, I hope to include (among other things):

- Lecture notes and problem sets for academic subjects
- Anki decks that contain flashcards for the corresponding academic subjects
- Auxiliary files such as LaTeX source files, style templates, vim snippets, configurations, etc. so that:
  - Anyone can download the repository in its current state and change/use it for their own purposes
  - Others can suggest changes to improve the content here
- More?

## How can I contribute?

At the moment-- you can't. This project is very much in its early stages, and so until I can get a few things going, I am not interested in collaboration or suggestions. However, if you notice errors in the academic material I have already provided here (of which there are many), feel free to contact me and I will fix them as I continue to work on this.

To see more about where this project is headed, I encourage you to check out the [open projects](https://github.com/gjgress/LibreMath/projects).
