\section{Complete Reducibility}
\label{sec:complete_reducibility}

Recall that the \textbf{characteristic} of a field \(K\) is the smallest positive integer \(p\) such that \(p 1_K = 0\). If \(p\) exists, then it is prime; else we say \(K\) has characteristic 0.

\begin{thm}
	Let \((V,\rho)\) be a representation of a finite group \(G\) of finite degree \(n\) over a field \(K\) of characteristic \(p\) with \(p \not\mid \left| G \right| \). If \(W\) is a subrepresentation of \((V,\rho)\), then there exists another subrepresentation \(W'\) of \(V\) so that
	\begin{align*}
		V \cong W \bigoplus W'
	\end{align*}
	as \(K\)-vector spaces. We refer to \(W'\) as the \textbf{complement} of the subrepresentation \(W\) of \((V,\rho)\).
\end{thm}

\begin{cor}[Maschke's Theorem]
	Let \(V\) be a representation of a finite group \(G\) of finite degree over a field of characteristic \(p\) with \(p \not\mid \left| G \right| \). Then \(V\) is completely reducible.
\end{cor}

This can be proven by induction on \(\textrm{dim}V\). Note that this fails for infinite groups.
