\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

These notes covers modules, unital and commutative rings, and fields.\\

The lecture notes are based off two main sources. The overall outline and the major statements of theorems and definitions are based off lecture notes from Dr.\@ Chelsea Walton during the Spring 2021 teaching of Rice's course MATH 357 -- \textit{Abstract Algebra II}. These notes are supplemented by exercises from Dummitt and Foote's \textit{Abstract Algebra}, and some of the basic ring material is based on Goodman's \textit{Algebra: Abstract and Concrete}. Finally, the applications of Galois theory are based on a section from Hungerford's \textit{Algebra}.
