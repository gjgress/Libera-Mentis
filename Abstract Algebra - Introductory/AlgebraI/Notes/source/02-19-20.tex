\section{Ring Homomorphism}	
\begin{defn}[Ring Homomorphism]
	Let \(R,S\) be rings. A map \(\varphi:R\to S\) that preserves operations is a \textbf{ring homomorphism}. In other words,
	\begin{align*}
		\varphi(a+b) = \varphi(a)+\varphi(b) \\
		\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)
	\end{align*}
\end{defn}
Note that \(\varphi(0) = 0\) and \(\varphi(-a) = -\varphi(a)\). Furthermore, the kernel of a ring homomorphism is an ideal
\begin{defn}[Isomorphism]
	Let \(R,S\) be rings. A function \(\varphi:R\to S\) that is bijective and a ring homomorphism is a \textbf{isomorphism}. If there exists a isomorphism between two rings, we say the rings are \textbf{isomorphic}. 
\end{defn}
\begin{prop}[Equivalence of Isomorphism]
	A ring homomorphism \(\varphi:R\to S\) is an isomorphism if and only if \( \textrm{Ker}\varphi = \left\{ 0 \right\} \) and \( \textrm{Im}\varphi = S\)
\end{prop}
This is of course equivalent to \(\varphi\) being bijective.
\begin{thm}[First Isomorphism Theorem]
	Let \(\varphi:R\to S\) be a ring homomorphism. Then \(R / \textrm{Ker}\varphi \simeq \textrm{Im}\varphi\).
\end{thm}
%\begin{proof}
%We know that
%\begin{align*}
%	a + \textrm{Ker}\varphi = b + \textrm{Ker}\varphi \iff \varphi(a) = \varphi(b).
%\end{align*}
%Let \(\psi:R / \textrm{Ker}\varphi \to \textrm{Im}\varphi\) be the map defined by \(a+I \mapsto \varphi(a)\). This map is well-defined and bijective. Now it suffices to show that \(\psi\) is a ring homomorphism.
%\begin{align*}
%	\psi\left( (a+ \textrm{Ker}\varphi) + (b + \textrm{Ker}\varphi) \right) = \psi\left( (a+b)+ \textrm{Ker}\varphi \right) = \varphi(a+b) = \varphi(a) + \varphi(b) 
%\end{align*}
%which is equivalent to the sum of elements of \(\psi\), as desired. One can check that multiplication holds the same as well.
%\end{proof}
This means that the homomorphism is completely determined by \(R\).
\begin{defn}[Natural Homomorphism]
	Let \(I \triangleleft R\) be an ideal of \(R\). There exists a \textbf{natural homomorphism}  \(\varphi:R\to R / I\) defined by \(\varphi:a\mapsto a+I\).
\end{defn}
\end{document}
