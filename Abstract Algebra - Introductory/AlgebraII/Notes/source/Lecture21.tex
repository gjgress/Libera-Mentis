\section{Algebraic Closure}
\label{sec:algebraic_closure}

Before, we were looking at extensions of some polynomial in \(F[x]\) that contains all the roots of the polynomial. Now we consider field extensions that contain \textit{all} the roots of all \(f(x) \in F[x]\).

\begin{defn}[Algebraic Closure]
	Given a field \(F\), a field \(\overline{F}\) is the \textbf{algebraic closure} of \(F\) if
	\begin{enumerate}[(a).]
		\item \(\overline{F}\) is algebraic over \(F\),
		\item Every polynomial \(f(x) \in F[x]\) splits completely over \(\overline{F}\)
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
Recall that splitting completely implies that \(f(x)\) factors into a product of degree 1 polynomials.

\begin{defn}[Algebraically Closed]
	A field \(K\) is \textbf{algebraically closed} if every polynomial with coefficients in \(K\) has a root in \(K\).
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
	If \(\overline{F}\) is the algebraic closure of \(F\), then \(\overline{F}\) is algebraically closed.
\end{prop}

\begin{hw}
	For a field \(K\), the following are equivalent:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(K\) is algebraically closed
		\item Every \(f(x)\in K[x]\) nonconstant splits completely over \(K\) 
		\item Every irreducible \(f(x) \in K[x]\) has degree 1
		\item There does not exist an algebraic extension of \(K\) other than \(K\) itself
	\end{itemize}
\end{hw}

\begin{prop}
	For every field \(F\) there exists an algebraically closed field \(K\) containing \(F\).
\end{prop}

\begin{hw}% Dummitt-Foote 13.4 #5
	Let \(K\) be a finite extension of \(F\). Prove that \(K\) is a splitting field over \(F\) if and only if every irreducible polynomial in \(F[x]\) that has a root in \(K\) splits completely in \(K[x]\).
\end{hw}
