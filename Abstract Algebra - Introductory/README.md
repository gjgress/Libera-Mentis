This is the folder that contains all introductory abstract algebra material.

Because the standard courses in abstract algebra differ in many places, I have chosen to combine the two introductory courses here. 

The material in Algebra I are based on a course I took with Dr. Robert Freud at BSM Fall 2020, as well as a few mathematics textbooks (will give more credit, WIP). The material in Algebra II are based on a course I took with Dr. Chelsea Walton at Rice in Spring 2021, as well as Dummitt and Foote and a few other mathematics textbooks.
